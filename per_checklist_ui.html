        <li>If you don't understand something, it's the writer's bug, not yours.</li>
        <li>Code reviews are as much about communication as they are about finding defects.</li>
        <li>Keep your tone respectful.</li>
        <li>Code reviews shouldn't be style checks. That's what linters are for.</li>
